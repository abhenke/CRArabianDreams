Counseling / Lessons / Training.
</h2>
<div class = "text">
This is for people with "problem" horses and beginners.  I help either here or on site with the owner and horse.
For problem horses, I help figure out what the "problem" is by talking with the owner and watching the horse and owner work together. I help both the horse and owner by giving them the knowledge of "reading" each others body language so they better understand each other. I will help find each of their strengths and weakness to be able to be a successful team on the trail or any events they are involved in.
For beginners, I help build confidence for both horse and owner. I teach steps in training. I also help with learning about equipment, cost, feed, care, and maintenance of a horse.<br><br>

<div class = "text">
We stand a few great stallions to the public,  and have a band of beautiful brood mares. We strive to produce my vision of the perfect Arabian; the original all around horse. Horses with sound bodies and minds that can go from the show ring to the trail and anything in between.
